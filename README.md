# Sirene

Sirene helps you to communicate with others when you're not able to use your voice. Designed for day-to-day conversational use, Sirene lets you speak with others when you're not able to use your voice, due to injury or other difficulties.

### How to build it

1. Check out the submodules via `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Create a Cloud Firestore project for both Android and iOS, and follow the steps to set it up (mostly just adding your Debug keystore SHA1 on Android, then copying in `GoogleServices.json` and `GoogleServices.plist` to the right place)
1. `./flutterw run`
