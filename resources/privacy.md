Sirene collects some information that we use to make the app better. We want to tell you about this before you use the app, so that if you're not comfortable with this, you can uninstall it or ask questions about what this information is exactly.

### *Usage information*

We collect usage information using Firebase Analytics - this info *can't* be used to identify you and *doesn't contain any of your data* or saved phrases, whether you log in or not. We use this to figure out what features people are actually using, and to find out if our app is running slowly / doing what it's supposed to.

Here's some examples of questions we'd answer with this info:

* "How long is the average phrase that people type in?"
* "Do people use the saved phrases feature?"
* "Are people typing stuff in then giving up / having problems for some reason?"

We keep this information to ourselves and don't share it to anyone else for any reason.

### *Your Data*

If you sign in, we save your data and settings in The Cloud (Cloud Firestore). This data is only for you, and we don't do any analytics on it. Again, we keep this information to ourselves and don't share it to anyone else for any reason.

Here's the data we store:

* Your saved phrases and how recently you've used them (so that we can sort them better)
* The last custom phrase you've typed in - we do this so that when you open and close the app, it's still there
* Your Email address, so that if you write in with problems, we can help you out.

### *More questions?*

Send an Email to support@peachapp.net and we'll help out.
